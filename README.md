# AWS---Automated-waste-segregator

This project proposesimplementation of an automated waste segregator at household level using Arduino
microcontroller, to control the entire process with ease and simplicity. The sensing unit consists of an
IR (Infrared) sensor, a moisturesensor and a metal sensor used to detect and identify various types of
waste respectively. The main architecture of the segregator comprises of three prominent stages
consisting of an IR sensor, a metal sensor, a moisture sensor and the segregation bins. The IR sensor
detects the arrival of waste. Identification and separation of waste is done by sensors. The
microcontroller controls all the activity of sensors. Results have presented segregation of waste into
metal, wet and dry waste.
The main goal of the project is to design and develop a sorting system that sorts and waste automatically
into two categories namely dry waste, wet waste.
